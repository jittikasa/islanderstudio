## Codebase Patterns

_Add reusable patterns here as you discover them. These persist across iterations._

### Database
- Path: `./data/content.db`
- Always close connections: `db.close()`
- JSON columns need `JSON.parse()`: `target_keywords`, `key_messages`, `data_points`

### Content
- Word count formula: `content.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 0).length`
- Draft naming: `[slug]-v[version].md`
- Published naming: `[slug]-final.md`

### Workflow
- Check available sources: `node src/content/list.js`
- Pipeline status: `npm run db:status`
- Query specific data: `node src/db/query.js [command]`
