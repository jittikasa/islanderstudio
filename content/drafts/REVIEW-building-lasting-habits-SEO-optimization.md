## 4. FAQ Schema Markup Suggestions

Add FAQ schema at the end of the post to increase SERP real estate and answer common questions.

### Recommended FAQ Section

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it really take to form a habit?
Research by Dr. Phillippa Lally shows it takes 18-254 days for a habit to become automatic,
with an average of 66 days—not the mythical 21 days. The timeline varies based on habit
complexity and individual factors.

### What is the pearl visualization method?
The pearl visualization method represents each habit completion as a pearl on a string.
Instead of checkmarks or numbers, you see your habit progress as something you're
building—like stringing pearls into a valuable necklace. This visual metaphor creates
stronger motivation than traditional habit trackers.

### Is Shellist free to use?
Yes, Shellist offers a free version with unlimited habit tracking. Premium features
(advanced analytics, custom themes) are available through an optional subscription.

### Does Shellist work on Apple Watch?
Currently, Shellist is available for iPhone and iPad with home screen widgets. An Apple
Watch companion app is in development.

### How is Shellist different from other iOS habit trackers?
Shellist uses the unique pearl visualization method that transforms habit tracking into
something beautiful and meaningful. Unlike apps that focus on streaks (which punish
missing days) or raw data, Shellist emphasizes the cumulative beauty of consistency.
