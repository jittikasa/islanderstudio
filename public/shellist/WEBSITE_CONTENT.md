Shellist Launches: Privacy-First Habit Tracker Transforms Progress into Pearls

[CITY, DATE] - Shellist, a new iOS habit tracking application, launches today with a unique approach to personal development. Unlike traditional habit trackers, Shellist visualizes progress as a growing pearl chain, combining beautiful design with powerful analytics while keeping all user data completely private.

Key features include pearl chain visualizations, comprehensive analytics, vision board integration, and complete data privacy with optional iCloud sync. The app is currently free with all features unlocked.

Shellist is available now on the App Store for iPhone and iPad running iOS 17.0 or later.
